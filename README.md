# Coding Challenge - FAQ accordion

I've completed a coding challenge from Front-end Mentor, in which, I had to make a really simple and repsonsive FAQ Accordion. 

Here is the design:

## What I Learned 
It was a first challenge from Front-end mentor that required me to write some JavaScript and it was fun to do so too! It allowed me to explore to get into the actual usecase of JavaScript and build something on my own. 

All in all, it was a starting point for me in JavaScript in terms of project based learning.
